# great-plate-count-translated
My name is Karen G. Lloyd, an Assistant Professor at the University of Tennessee in the field of Microbiology. One of the foundational theories in environmental microbiology is the Great Plate Count Anomaly, first described as such in 1985 by Staley and Konopka in the Annual Reviews of Microbiology 39:321-46. This theory states that only a small percentage of the total microbial cells present in an environmental sample can be cultivated under common laboratory conditions. They cite the first report of this phenomenon in a paper that is written in Russian, Razumov, A. S. 1932. Mikrobiologija 1: 131-46. I don't read Russian, so I asked Tatiana Vishnivetskaya, Research Assistant Professor in the Center for Environmental Biotechnology, to translate it for me. Neither of us are trained as translators, and we accomplished this over just a few hours. So, I imagine the translation could be improved. But, it suffices to make this important, foundational work accessible to Western scientists, for whom English is the common language. I hope that it can be helpful to my colleagues who would also like to read this paper. 

If you would like to improve the translation, please do so.
